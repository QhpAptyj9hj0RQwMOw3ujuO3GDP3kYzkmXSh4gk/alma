# 007 [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/masak/007.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/masak/007)

007 is a small language created as a testbed for Perl 6 macros. Its goal as a
language is to inform the implementation of macros in Perl 6, by means of being
a faster-moving code base and easier to iterate on towards good solutions.

Rakudo already contains a rudimentary implementation of macros, but at this
point the most mature macro implementation for Perl 6 is embodied in 007.

The name "007" was chosen because the data type representing program fragments
is called `Q`.

## Get it

If you're just planning to be a 007 end user, `zef` is the recommended way to
install 007:

```sh
zef install 007
```

(If you want to install from source, see [the
documentation](http://masak.github.io/007/#installation-from-source).)

### Run it

Now this should work:

```sh
$ 007 -e='say("OH HAI")'
OH HAI

$ 007 examples/format.007
abracadabra
foo{1}bar
```

## Status

007 is currently in development.

The explicit goal is to reach some level of feature completeness for macros in
007, and then to backport that solution to Rakudo.
